# -EGT-POMDP-Adaptive-Honeypot-Deployment-Deception-Framework-
This Python script is a cybersecurity simulation framework designed to model and optimize honeypot deployment strategies in SDN environments. It combines Evolutionary Game Theory and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) to simulate the dynamic interactions between network attackers and defenders.
